# Kotlin∇: A Typesafe AD implementation for Kotlin

Inspired by [Stalin∇](https://github.com/Functional-AutoDiff/STALINGRAD), [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd), [DiffSharp](https://github.com/DiffSharp/DiffSharp), [Tangent](https://github.com/google/tangent) and others, Kotlin∇ allows you to calculate exact derivatives for numerical functions.

Gradients are particularly useful for continuous optimization and have a variety of applications in robotics and machine learning.

We aim to provide an algebraic implementation of AD for type safe tensor manipulations.
